## 🏗️ **Claude Skills Architecture: Understanding What We Create**

### **Important Terminology Clarification**

This meta-skill creates **Claude Skills**, which come in different architectural patterns:

#### **📋 Skill Types We Can Create**

**1. Simple Skill** (Single focused capability)

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              ← Single comprehensive skill file
├── scripts/              ← Optional supporting code
├── references/           ← Optional documentation
└── assets/               ← Optional templates
```

*Use when: Single objective, simple workflow, <1000 lines code*

**2. Complex Skill Suite** (Multiple specialized capabilities)

```
skill-suite/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json  ← Organizes multiple component skills
├── component-1/
│   └── SKILL.md          ← Specialized sub-skill
├── component-2/
│   └── SKILL.md          ← Another specialized sub-skill
└── shared/               ← Shared resources
```

*Use when: Multiple related workflows, >2000 lines code, team maintenance*

#### **🎯 Architecture Decision Process**

During **PHASE 3: ARCHITECTURE**, this skill will:

1. **Analyze Complexity Requirements**
   - Number of distinct workflows
   - Code complexity estimation
   - Maintenance considerations

2. **Choose Appropriate Architecture**
   - Simple task → Simple Skill
   - Complex multi-domain task → Skill Suite
   - Hybrid requirements → Simple skill with components

3. **Apply Naming Convention**
   - Generate descriptive base name from requirements
   - Add "-cskill" suffix to identify as Claude Skill created by Agent-Skill-Creator
   - Ensure consistent, professional naming across all created skills

4. **Document the Decision**
   - Create `DECISIONS.md` explaining architecture choice
   - Provide rationale for selected pattern
   - Include migration path if needed
   - Document naming convention applied

#### **🏷️ Naming Convention: "-cskill" Suffix**

**All skills created by this Agent-Skill-Creator use the "-cskill" suffix:**

**Simple Skills:**

- `pdf-text-extractor-cskill/`
- `csv-data-cleaner-cskill/`
- `weekly-report-generator-cskill/`

**Complex Skill Suites:**

- `financial-analysis-suite-cskill/`
- `e-commerce-automation-cskill/`
- `research-workflow-cskill/`

**Component Skills (within suites):**

- `data-acquisition-cskill/`
- `technical-analysis-cskill/`
- `reporting-generator-cskill/`

**Purpose of "-cskill" suffix:**

- ✅ **Clear Identification**: Immediately recognizable as a Claude Skill
- ✅ **Origin Attribution**: Created by Agent-Skill-Creator
- ✅ **Consistent Convention**: Professional naming standard
- ✅ **Avoids Confusion**: Distinguishes from manually created skills
- ✅ **Easy Organization**: Simple to identify and group created skills

#### **📚 Reference Documentation**

For complete understanding of Claude Skills architecture, see:

- `docs/CLAUDE_SKILLS_ARCHITECTURE.md` (comprehensive guide)
- `docs/DECISION_LOGIC.md` (architecture decision framework)
- `examples/` (simple vs complex examples)
- `examples/simple-skill/` (minimal example)
- `examples/complex-skill-suite/` (comprehensive example)

#### **✅ What We Create**

**ALWAYS creates a valid Claude Skill** - either:

- **Simple Skill** (single SKILL.md)
- **Complex Skill Suite** (multiple component skills with marketplace.json)

**NEVER creates "plugins" in the traditional sense** - we create Skills, which may be organized using marketplace.json for complex suites.

This terminology consistency eliminates confusion between Skills and Plugins.

## Autonomous Creation Protocol

### Fundamental Principles

**Autonomy**:

- ✅ Claude DECIDES which API to use (doesn't ask user)
- ✅ Claude DEFINES which analyses to perform (based on value)
- ✅ Claude STRUCTURES optimally (best practices)
- ✅ Claude IMPLEMENTS complete code (no placeholders)
- ✅ **NEW**: Claude LEARNS from experience (AgentDB integration)

**Quality**:

- ✅ Production-ready code (no TODOs)
- ✅ Useful documentation (not "see docs")
- ✅ Real configs (no placeholders)
- ✅ Robust error handling
- ✅ **NEW**: Intelligence validated with mathematical proofs

**Completeness**:

- ✅ Complete SKILL.md (5000+ words)
- ✅ Functional scripts (1000+ lines total)
- ✅ References with content (3000+ words)
- ✅ Valid assets/configs
- ✅ README with instructions

### Requirements Extraction

When user describes workflow vaguely, extract:

**From what the user said**:

- Domain (agriculture? finance? weather?)
- Data source (mentioned? if not, research)
- Main tasks (download? analyze? compare?)
- Frequency (daily? weekly? on-demand?)
- Current time spent (to calculate ROI)

**🆕 Enhanced Analysis (v2.0)**:

- **Multi-Agent Detection**: Look for keywords like "suite", "multiple", "separate agents"
- **Transcript Analysis**: Detect if input is a video/transcript requiring workflow extraction
- **Template Matching**: Identify if user wants template-based creation
- **Interactive Preference**: Detect if user wants guidance vs full autonomy
- **Integration Needs**: Determine if agents should communicate with each other

**🆕 Transcript Processing**:

When user provides transcripts:

```python
# Enhanced transcript analysis
def analyze_transcript(transcript: str) -> List[WorkflowSpec]:
    """Extract multiple workflows from transcripts automatically"""
    workflows = []

    # 1. Identify distinct processes
    processes = extract_processes(transcript)

    # 2. Group related steps
    for process in processes:
        steps = extract_sequence_steps(transcript, process)
        apis = extract_mentioned_apis(transcript, process)
        outputs = extract_desired_outputs(transcript, process)

        workflows.append(WorkflowSpec(
            name=process,
            steps=steps,
            apis=apis,
            outputs=outputs
        ))

    return workflows
```

**🆕 Multi-Agent Strategy Decision**:

```python
def determine_creation_strategy(user_input: str, workflows: List[WorkflowSpec]) -> CreationStrategy:
    """Decide whether to create single agent, suite, or integrated system"""

    if len(workflows) > 1:
        if workflows_are_related(workflows):
            return CreationStrategy.INTEGRATED_SUITE
        else:
            return CreationStrategy.MULTI_AGENT_SUITE
    else:
        return CreationStrategy.SINGLE_AGENT
```

**Questions to ask** (only if critical and not inferable):

- "Prefer free API or paid is ok?"
- "Need historical data for how many years?"
- "Focus on which geography/country?"
- **🆕 "Create separate agents or integrated suite?"** (if multiple workflows detected)
- **🆕 "Want interactive preview before creation?"** (for complex projects)

**Rule**: Minimize questions. Infer/decide whenever possible.

## 🎯 Template-Based Creation (NEW v2.0)

### Available Templates

The enhanced agent-creator includes pre-built templates for common domains:

**📊 Financial Analysis Template**

```json
Domain: Finance & Investments
APIs: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance
Analyses: Fundamental, Technical, Portfolio
Time: 15-20 minutes
```

**🌡️ Climate Analysis Template**

```json
Domain: Climate & Environmental
APIs: Open-Meteo, NOAA
Analyses: Anomalies, Trends, Seasonal
Time: 20-25 minutes
```

**🛒 E-commerce Analytics Template**

```json
Domain: Business & E-commerce
APIs: Google Analytics, Stripe, Shopify
Analyses: Traffic, Revenue, Cohort, Products
Time: 25-30 minutes
```

### Template Matching Process

```python
def match_template(user_input: str) -> TemplateMatch:
    """Automatically suggest best template based on user input"""

    # 1. Extract keywords from user input
    keywords = extract_keywords(user_input)

    # 2. Calculate similarity scores with all templates
    matches = []
    for template in available_templates:
        score = calculate_similarity(keywords, template.keywords)
        matches.append((template, score))

    # 3. Rank by similarity
    matches.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # 4. Return best match if confidence > threshold
    if matches[0][1] > 0.7:
        return TemplateMatch(template=matches[0][0], confidence=matches[0][1])
    else:
        return None  # No suitable template found
```

### Template Usage Examples

**Direct Template Request:**

```
"Create an agent using the financial-analysis template"
→ Uses pre-configured structure
→ 80% faster creation
→ Proven architecture
```

**Automatic Template Detection:**

```
"I need to analyze stock performance and calculate RSI, MACD"
→ Detects financial domain
→ Suggests financial-analysis template
→ User confirms or continues custom
```

**Template Customization:**

```
"Use the climate template but add drought analysis"
→ Starts with climate template
→ Adds custom drought analysis
→ Modifies structure accordingly
```

## 🚀 Batch Agent Creation (NEW v2.0)

### Multi-Agent Suite Creation

The enhanced agent-creator can create multiple agents in a single operation:

**When to Use Batch Creation:**

- Transcript describes multiple distinct workflows
- User explicitly asks for multiple agents
- Complex system requiring specialized components
- Microservices architecture preferred

### Batch Creation Process

```python
def create_agent_suite(user_input: str, workflows: List[WorkflowSpec]) -> AgentSuite:
    """Create multiple related agents in one operation"""

    # 1. Analyze workflow relationships
    relationships = analyze_workflow_relationships(workflows)

    # 2. Determine optimal structure
    if workflows_are_tightly_coupled(workflows):
        structure = "integrated_suite"
    else:
        structure = "independent_agents"

    # 3. Create suite directory
    suite_name = generate_suite_name(user_input)
    create_suite_directory(suite_name)

    # 4. Create each agent
    agents = []
    for workflow in workflows:
        agent = create_single_agent(workflow, suite_name)
        agents.append(agent)

    # 5. Create integration layer (if needed)
    if structure == "integrated_suite":
        create_integration_layer(agents, suite_name)

    # 6. Create suite-level marketplace.json
    create_suite_marketplace_json(suite_name, agents)

    return AgentSuite(name=suite_name, agents=agents, structure=structure)
```

### Batch Creation Examples

**First Week:**

```
"Analyze Tesla stock"
🤖 "📊 Tesla analysis: RSI 65.3, MACD bullish"
```

**After One Month:**

```
"Analyze Tesla stock"
🤖 "📊 Tesla analysis: RSI 65.3, MACD bullish (enhanced with your patterns)"
🤖 "🧠 Pattern detected: You always ask on Mondays - prepared weekly analysis"
🤖 "📈 Added volatility prediction based on your usage patterns"
```

### Technical Implementation (Invisible to Users)

```python
# This happens automatically behind the scenes
class AgentCreatorV21:
    def create_agent(self, user_input):
        # AgentDB enhancement (invisible)
        intelligence = enhance_agent_creation(user_input)

        # Enhanced template selection
        template = intelligence.template_choice or self.default_template

        # Learned improvements automatically applied
        improvements = intelligence.learned_improvements

        # Create agent with enhanced intelligence
        return self.create_with_intelligence(template, improvements)
```

### Graceful Fallback

If AgentDB isn't available (rare), the agent-creator works exactly like v2.0:

```
"Create agent for financial analysis"
🤖 "✅ Agent created (standard mode)"
```

No interruption, no errors, just no learning enhancements.

### Privacy & Performance

- ✅ All learning happens locally on your machine
- ✅ No external dependencies required
- ✅ Automatic cleanup and optimization
- ✅ Zero impact on creation speed

## 📦 Cross-Platform Export (NEW v3.2)

### What This Feature Does

**Automatically package skills for use across all Claude platforms:**

Skills created in Claude Code can be exported for:

- ✅ **Claude Desktop** - Manual .zip upload
- ✅ **claude.ai** (Web) - Browser-based upload
- ✅ **Claude API** - Programmatic integration

This makes your skills portable and shareable across all Claude ecosystems.

### When to Activate Export

Claude should activate export capabilities when user says:

✅ **Export requests:**

- "Export [skill-name] for Desktop"
- "Package [skill-name] for claude.ai"
- "Create API package for [skill-name]"
- "Export [skill-name] for all platforms"

✅ **Cross-platform requests:**

- "Make [skill-name] compatible with Claude Desktop"
- "I need to share [skill-name] with Desktop users"
- "Package [skill-name] as .zip"
- "Create cross-platform version of [skill-name]"

✅ **Version-specific exports:**

- "Export [skill-name] with version 2.0.1"
- "Package [skill-name] v1.5.0 for API"

### Export Process

When user requests export:

**Step 1: Locate Skill**

```python
# Search common locations
locations = [
    f"./{skill_name}-cskill/",  # Current directory
    f"references/examples/{skill_name}-cskill/",  # Examples
    user_specified_path  # If provided
]

skill_path = find_skill(locations)
```

**Step 2: Validate Structure**

```python
# Ensure skill is export-ready
valid, issues = validate_skill_structure(skill_path)

if not valid:
    report_issues_to_user(issues)
    return
```

**Step 3: Execute Export**

```bash
# Run export utility
python scripts/export_utils.py {skill_path} \
    --variant {desktop|api|both} \
    --version {version} \
    --output-dir exports/
```

**Step 4: Report Results**

```
✅ Export completed!

📦 Packages created:
   - Desktop: exports/{skill}-desktop-v1.0.0.zip (2.3 MB)
   - API: exports/{skill}-api-v1.0.0.zip (1.2 MB)

📄 Installation guide: exports/{skill}-v1.0.0_INSTALL.md

🎯 Ready for:
   ✅ Claude Desktop upload
   ✅ claude.ai upload
   ✅ Claude API integration
```

### Post-Creation Export (Opt-In)

After successfully creating a skill in PHASE 5, offer export:

```
✅ Skill created successfully: {skill-name-cskill}/

📦 Cross-Platform Export Options:

Would you like to create export packages for other Claude platforms?

   1. Desktop/Web (.zip for manual upload)
   2. API (.zip for programmatic use)
   3. Both (comprehensive package)
   4. Skip (Claude Code only)

Choice: _
```

**If user chooses 1, 2, or 3:**

- Execute export_utils.py with selected variants
- Report package locations
- Provide next steps for each platform

**If user chooses 4 or skips:**

- Continue with normal completion
- Skill remains Claude Code only

### Export Variants

**Desktop/Web Package** (`*-desktop-*.zip`):

- Complete documentation
- All scripts and assets
- Full references
- Optimized for user experience
- Typical size: 2-5 MB

**API Package** (`*-api-*.zip`):

- Execution-focused
- Size-optimized (< 8MB)
- Minimal documentation
- Essential scripts only
- Typical size: 0.5-2 MB

### Version Detection

Automatically detect version from:

1. **Git tags** (priority):

   ```bash
   git describe --tags --abbrev=0
   ```

2. **SKILL.md frontmatter**:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   version: 1.2.3
   ---
   ```

3. **Default**: `v1.0.0`

**User can override**:

- "Export with version 2.1.0"
- `--version 2.1.0` flag

### Export Validation

Before creating packages, validate:

✅ **Required:**

- SKILL.md exists
- Valid frontmatter (---...---)
- `name:` field present (≤ 64 chars)
- `description:` field present (≤ 1024 chars)

✅ **Size Checks:**

- Desktop: Reasonable size
- API: < 8MB (hard limit)

✅ **Security:**

- No .env files
- No credentials.json
- No sensitive data

If validation fails, report specific issues to user.

### Installation Guides

Auto-generate platform-specific guides:

**File**: `exports/{skill}-v{version}_INSTALL.md`

**Contents:**

- Package information
- Installation steps for Desktop
- Installation steps for claude.ai
- API integration code examples
- Platform comparison table
- Troubleshooting tips

### Export Commands Reference

- **Export Guide**: `references/export-guide.md`
- **Cross-Platform Guide**: `references/cross-platform-guide.md`
- **Exports README**: `exports/README.md`

### Integration with AgentDB

Export process can leverage AgentDB learning:

- Remember successful export configurations
- Suggest optimal variant based on use case
- Track which exports are most commonly used
- Learn from export failures to improve validation

---

## PHASE 1: Discovery and Research

**Objective**: DECIDE which API/data source to use with AgentDB intelligence

### Process

**1.1 Identify domain and query AgentDB**

From user input, identify the domain and immediately query AgentDB for learned patterns:

```python
# Import AgentDB bridge (invisible to user)
from integrations.agentdb_bridge import get_agentdb_bridge

# Get AgentDB intelligence
bridge = get_agentdb_bridge()
intelligence = bridge.enhance_agent_creation(user_input, domain)

# Log: AgentDB provides insights if available
if intelligence.learned_improvements:
    print(f"🧠 Found {len(intelligence.learned_improvements)} relevant patterns")
```

**Domain mapping with AgentDB insights:**

- Agriculture → APIs: USDA NASS, FAO, World Bank Ag
- Finance → APIs: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, Fed Economic Data
- Weather → APIs: NOAA, OpenWeather, Weather.gov
- Economy → APIs: World Bank, IMF, FRED

**1.2 Research available APIs with learned preferences**

For the domain, use WebSearch to find:

- Available public APIs
- Documentation
- Characteristics (free? rate limits? coverage?)

**AgentDB Enhancement**: Prioritize APIs that have shown higher success rates:

```python
# AgentDB influences search based on historical success
if intelligence.success_probability > 0.8:
    print(f"🎯 High success domain detected - optimizing API selection")
```

**Example with AgentDB insights**:

```
WebSearch: "US agriculture API free historical data"
WebSearch: "USDA API documentation"
WebFetch: [doc URLs found]

# AgentDB check: "Has similar domain been successful before?"
# AgentDB provides: "USDA NASS: 94% success rate in agriculture domain"
```

**1.3 Compare options with AgentDB validation**

Create mental table comparing:

- Data coverage (fit with need)
- Cost (free vs paid)
- Rate limits (sufficient?)
- Data quality (official? reliable?)
- Documentation (good? examples?)
- Ease of use
- **🧠 AgentDB Success Rate** (historical validation)

**AgentDB Mathematical Validation**:

```python
# AgentDB provides mathematical proof for selection
if intelligence.mathematical_proof:
    print(f"📊 API selection validated: {intelligence.mathematical_proof}")
```

**1.4 DECIDE with AgentDB confidence**

Choose 1 API and justify with AgentDB backing:

**Decision with AgentDB confidence:**

- **Selected API**: [API name]
- **Success Probability**: {intelligence.success_probability:.1%}
- **Mathematical Proof**: {intelligence.mathematical_proof}
- **Learned Improvements**: {intelligence.learned_improvements}

**Document decision** in separate file:

```markdown
# Architecture Decisions

## Selected API: [Name]

**Justification**:
- ✅ Coverage: [details]
- ✅ Cost: [free/paid]
- ✅ Rate limit: [number]
- ✅ Quality: [official/private]
- ✅ Docs: [quality]

**Alternatives considered**:
- API X: Rejected because [reason]
- API Y: Rejected because [reason]

**Conclusion**: [Chosen API] is the best option because [synthesis]
```

**1.5 Research technical details**

Use WebFetch to load API documentation and extract:

- Base URL
- Main endpoints
- Authentication
- Important parameters
- Response format
- Rate limits
- Request/response examples

**See** `references/phase1-discovery.md` for complete details.

## PHASE 2: Analysis Design

**Objective**: DEFINE which analyses the agent will perform

### Process

**2.1 Think about use cases**

For the described workflow, which questions will the user ask frequently?

**Brainstorm**: List 10-15 typical questions

**2.2 Group by analysis type**

Group similar questions:

- Simple queries (fetch + format)
- Temporal comparisons (YoY)
- Rankings (sort + share)
- Trends (time series + CAGR)
- Projections (forecasting)
- Aggregations (regional/categorical)

**2.3 DEFINE priority analyses**

Choose 4-6 analyses that cover 80% of use cases.

For each analysis:

- Name
- Objective
- Required inputs
- Expected outputs
- Methodology (formulas, transformations)
- Interpretation

**2.4 ADD Comprehensive Report Function** (🆕 Enhancement #8 - MANDATORY!)

**⚠️ COMMON PROBLEM:** v1.0 skills had isolated functions. When user asks for "complete report", Claude didn't know how to combine all analyses.

**Solution:** ALWAYS include as last analysis function:

```python
def comprehensive_{domain}_report(
    entity: str,
    year: Optional[int] = None,
    include_metrics: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    client: Optional[Any] = None
) -> Dict:
    """
    Generate comprehensive report combining ALL available metrics.

    This is a "one-stop" function that users can call to get
    complete picture without knowing individual functions.

    Args:
        entity: Entity to analyze (e.g., commodity, stock, location)
        year: Year (None for current year with auto-detection)
        include_metrics: Which metrics to include (None = all available)
        client: API client instance (optional, created if None)

    Returns:
        Dict with ALL metrics consolidated:
        {
            'entity': str,
            'year': int,
            'year_info': str,
            'generated_at': str (ISO timestamp),
            'metrics': {
                'metric1_name': {metric1_data},
                'metric2_name': {metric2_data},
                ...
            },
            'summary': str (overall insights),
            'alerts': List[str] (important findings)
        }

    Example:
        >>> report = comprehensive_{domain}_report("CORN")
        >>> print(report['summary'])
        "CORN 2025: Production up 5% YoY, yield at record high..."
    """
    from datetime import datetime
    from utils.helpers import get_{domain}_year_with_fallback, format_year_message

    # Auto-detect year
    year_requested = year
    if year is None:
        year, _ = get_{domain}_year_with_fallback()

    # Initialize report
    report = {
        'entity': entity,
        'year': year,
        'year_requested': year_requested,
        'year_info': format_year_message(year, year_requested),
        'generated_at': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'metrics': {},
        'alerts': []
    }

    # Determine which metrics to include
    if include_metrics is None:
        # Include ALL available metrics
        metrics_to_fetch = ['{metric1}', '{metric2}', '{metric3}', ...]
    else:
        metrics_to_fetch = include_metrics

    # Call ALL individual analysis functions
    # Graceful degradation: if one fails, others still run

    if '{metric1}' in metrics_to_fetch:
        try:
            report['metrics']['{metric1}'] = {metric1}_analysis(entity, year, client)
        except Exception as e:
            report['metrics']['{metric1}'] = {
                'error': str(e),
                'status': 'unavailable'
            }
            report['alerts'].append(f"{metric1} data unavailable: {e}")

    if '{metric2}' in metrics_to_fetch:
        try:
            report['metrics']['{metric2}'] = {metric2}_analysis(entity, year, client)
        except Exception as e:
            report['metrics']['{metric2}'] = {
                'error': str(e),
                'status': 'unavailable'
            }

    # Repeat for ALL metrics...

    # Generate summary based on all available data
    report['summary'] = _generate_summary(report['metrics'], entity, year)

    # Detect important findings
    report['alerts'].extend(_detect_alerts(report['metrics']))

    return report


def _generate_summary(metrics: Dict, entity: str, year: int) -> str:
    """Generate human-readable summary from all metrics."""
    insights = []

    # Extract key insights from each metric
    for metric_name, metric_data in metrics.items():
        if 'error' not in metric_data:
            # Extract most important insight from this metric
            key_insight = _extract_key_insight(metric_name, metric_data)
            if key_insight:
                insights.append(key_insight)

    # Combine into coherent summary
    if insights:
        summary = f"{entity} {year}: " + ". ".join(insights[:3])  # Top 3 insights
    else:
        summary = f"{entity} {year}: No data available"

    return summary


def _detect_alerts(metrics: Dict) -> List[str]:
    """Detect significant findings that need attention."""
    alerts = []

    # Check each metric for alert conditions
    for metric_name, metric_data in metrics.items():
        if 'error' in metric_data:
            continue

        # Domain-specific alert logic
        # Example: Large changes, extreme values, anomalies
        if metric_name == '{metric1}' and 'change_percent' in metric_data:
            if abs(metric_data['change_percent']) > 15:
                alerts.append(
                    f"⚠ Large {metric1} change: {metric_data['change_percent']:.1f}%"
                )

    return alerts
```

**Why it's mandatory:**

- ✅ Users want "complete report" → 1 function does everything
- ✅ Ideal for executive dashboards
- ✅ Facilitates sales ("everything in one report")
- ✅ Much better UX (no need to know individual functions)

**When to mention in SKILL.md:**

```markdown
## Comprehensive Analysis (All-in-One)

To get a complete report combining ALL metrics:

Use the `comprehensive_{domain}_report()` function.

This function:
- Fetches ALL available metrics
- Combines into single report
- Generates automatic summary
- Detects important alerts
- Degrades gracefully (if 1 metric fails, others work)

Usage example:
"Generate complete report for {entity}"
"Complete dashboard for {entity}"
"All metrics for {entity}"
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ 10x better UX (1 query = everything)
- ✅ More useful skills for end users
- ✅ Facilitates commercial adoption

**2.5 Specify methodologies**

For quantitative analyses, define:

- Mathematical formulas
- Statistical validations
- Interpretations
- Edge cases

**See** `references/phase2-design.md` for detailed methodologies.

## PHASE 3: Architecture

**Objective**: STRUCTURE the agent optimally

### Process

**3.1 Define folder structure**

Based on analyses and API:

```
agent-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/
│   ├── [fetch/parse/analyze separate or together?]
│   └── utils/
│       └── [cache? rate limiter? validators?]
├── references/
│   └── [API docs? methodologies? troubleshooting?]
└── assets/
    └── [configs? metadata?]
```

**Decisions**:

- Separate scripts (modular) vs monolithic?
- Which utilities needed?
- Which references useful?
- Which configs/assets?

**3.2 Define responsibilities**

For each script, specify:

- File name
- Function/purpose
- Input and output
- Specific responsibilities
- ~Expected number of lines

**3.3 Plan references**

Which reference files to create?

- API guide (how to use API)
- Analysis methods (methodologies)
- Troubleshooting (common errors)
- Domain knowledge (domain context)

**3.4 Performance strategy**

- Cache: What to cache? TTL?
- Rate limiting: How to control?
- Optimizations: Parallelization? Lazy loading?

**See** `references/phase3-architecture.md` for structuring patterns.

## PHASE 4: Automatic Detection

**Objective**: DETERMINE keywords for automatic activation

### Process

**4.1 List domain entities**

- Organizations/data sources
- Main metrics
- Geography (countries, regions, states)
- Temporality (years, periods)

**4.2 List typical actions**

- Query: "what", "how much", "show"
- Compare: "compare", "vs", "versus"
- Rank: "top", "best", "ranking"
- Analyze: "trend", "growth", "analyze"
- Forecast: "predict", "project", "forecast"

**4.3 List question variations**

For each analysis type, how might the user ask?

**4.4 Define negative scope**

Important! What should NOT activate the skill?

**4.5 Create precise description**

With all keywords identified, create ~200 word description that:

- Mentions domain
- Lists main keywords
- Gives examples
- Defines negative scope

**See** `references/phase4-detection.md` for complete guide.

### 🎯 3-Layer Activation System (v3.0)

**Important**: As of Agent-Skill-Creator v3.0, we now use a **3-Layer Activation System** to achieve 95%+ activation reliability.

#### Why 3 Layers?

Previous skills that relied only on description achieved ~70% activation reliability. The 3-layer system dramatically improves this to 95%+ by combining:

1. **Layer 1: Keywords** - Exact phrase matching (high precision)
2. **Layer 2: Patterns** - Regex flexible matching (coverage for variations)
3. **Layer 3: Description + NLU** - Claude's understanding (fallback for edge cases)

#### Quick Implementation Guide

**Layer 1: Keywords (10-15 phrases)**

```json
"activation": {
  "keywords": [
    "create an agent for",
    "automate workflow",
    "technical analysis for",
    "RSI indicator",
    // 10-15 total complete phrases
  ]
}
```

**Requirements:**

- ✅ Complete phrases (2+ words)
- ✅ Action verb + entity
- ✅ Domain-specific terms
- ❌ No single words
- ❌ No overly generic phrases

**Layer 2: Patterns (5-7 regex)**

```json
"patterns": [
  "(?i)(create|build)\\s+(an?\\s+)?agent\\s+for",
  "(?i)(automate|automation)\\s+(workflow|process)",
  "(?i)(analyze|analysis)\\s+.*\\s+(stock|data)",
  // 5-7 total patterns
]
```

**Requirements:**

- ✅ Start with `(?i)` for case-insensitivity
- ✅ Include action verbs + entities
- ✅ Allow flexible word order
- ✅ Specific enough to avoid false positives
- ✅ Flexible enough to capture variations

**Layer 3: Enhanced Description (300-500 chars, 60+ keywords)**

```
Comprehensive [domain] tool. [Primary capability] including [specific-feature-1],
[specific-feature-2], and [specific-feature-3]. Generates [output-type] based on
[method]. Compares [entity-type] for [analysis-type]. Monitors [target] and tracks
[metric]. Perfect for [user-persona] needing [use-case-1], [use-case-2], and
[use-case-3] using [methodology].
```

**Requirements:**

- ✅ 60+ unique keywords
- ✅ All Layer 1 keywords included naturally
- ✅ Domain-specific terminology
- ✅ Use cases clearly stated
- ✅ Natural language flow

#### Usage Sections

Add to marketplace.json:

```json
"usage": {
  "when_to_use": [
    "User explicitly asks to [capability-1]",
    "User mentions [indicator-name] or [domain-term]",
    "User describes [use-case-scenario]",
    // 5+ use cases
  ],
  "when_not_to_use": [
    "User asks for [out-of-scope-1]",
    "User wants [different-skill-capability]",
    // 3+ counter-cases
  ]
}
```

#### Test Queries

Add to marketplace.json:

```json
"test_queries": [
  "Query testing keyword-1",
  "Query testing pattern-2",
  "Query testing description understanding",

---

## PHASE 5: Complete Implementation

**Objective**: IMPLEMENT everything with REAL code

### ⚠️ MANDATORY QUALITY STANDARDS

Before starting implementation, read `references/quality-standards.md`.

**NEVER DO**:

- ❌ `# TODO: implement`
- ❌ `pass` in functions
- ❌ "See external documentation"
- ❌ Configs with "YOUR_KEY_HERE" without instructions
- ❌ Empty references or just links

**ALWAYS DO**:

- ✅ Complete and functional code
- ✅ Detailed docstrings
- ✅ Robust error handling
- ✅ Type hints
- ✅ Validations
- ✅ Real content in references
- ✅ Configs with real values

### 🚨 STEP 0: BEFORE EVERYTHING - Marketplace.json (MANDATORY)

**STOP! READ THIS BEFORE CONTINUING!**

🛑 **CRITICAL BLOCKER**: You CANNOT create ANY other file until completing this step.

**Why marketplace.json is step 0:**

- ❌ Without this file, the skill CANNOT be installed via `/plugin marketplace add`
- ❌ All the work creating the agent will be USELESS without it
- ❌ This is the most common error when creating agents - DO NOT make this mistake!

#### Step 0.1: Create basic structure

```bash
mkdir -p agent-name/.claude-plugin
```

#### Step 0.2: Create marketplace.json IMMEDIATELY

Create `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with this content:

```json
{
  "name": "agent-name",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Agent Creator",
    "email": "noreply@example.com"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Brief agent description",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "created": "2025-10-17"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "agent-plugin",
      "description": "THIS DESCRIPTION MUST BE IDENTICAL to the description in SKILL.md frontmatter that you'll create in the next step",
      "source": "./",
      "strict": false,
      "skills": ["./"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL FIELDS:**

- `name`: Agent name (same as directory name)
- `plugins[0].description`: **MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL** to SKILL.md frontmatter description
- `plugins[0].skills`: `["./"]` points to SKILL.md in root
- `plugins[0].source`: `"./"` points to agent root

#### Step 0.3: VALIDATE IMMEDIATELY (before continuing!)

**Execute NOW these validation commands:**

```bash
# 1. Validate JSON syntax
python3 -c "import json; print('✅ Valid JSON'); json.load(open('agent-name/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json'))"

# 2. Verify file exists
ls -la agent-name/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json

# If any command fails: STOP and fix before continuing!
```

**✅ CHECKLIST - You MUST complete ALL before proceeding:**

- [ ] ✅ File `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` created
- [ ] ✅ JSON is syntactically valid (validated with python)
- [ ] ✅ Field `name` is correct
- [ ] ✅ Field `plugins[0].description` ready to receive SKILL.md description
- [ ] ✅ Field `plugins[0].skills` = `["./"]`
- [ ] ✅ Field `plugins[0].source` = `"./"`

**🛑 ONLY PROCEED AFTER VALIDATING ALL ITEMS ABOVE!**

---

### Implementation Order (AFTER marketplace.json validated)

Now that marketplace.json is created and validated, proceed:

**1. Create rest of directory structure**

```bash
mkdir -p agent-name/{scripts/utils,references,assets,data/{raw,processed,cache,analysis}}
```

**2. Create SKILL.md**

Mandatory structure:

- Frontmatter (name, description)
- When to use
- How it works (overview)
- Data source (detailed API)
- Workflows (step-by-step by question type)
- Available scripts (each explained)
- Available analyses (each explained)
- Error handling (all expected errors)
- Mandatory validations
- Performance and cache
- Keywords for detection
- Usage examples (5+ complete)

**Size**: 5000-7000 words

**⚠️ AFTER creating SKILL.md: SYNCHRONIZE description with marketplace.json!**

**CRITICAL**: Now that SKILL.md is created with its frontmatter, you MUST:

```bash
# Edit marketplace.json to update description
# Copy EXACTLY the description from SKILL.md frontmatter
# Paste in .claude-plugin/marketplace.json → plugins[0].description
```

**Verify synchronization:**

- SKILL.md frontmatter description = marketplace.json plugins[0].description
- Must be IDENTICAL (word for word!)
- Without this, skill won't activate automatically

**3. Implement Python scripts**

**Order** (MANDATORY):

1. **Utils first** (including helpers.py + validators/ - CRITICAL!)
   - `utils/helpers.py` (🔴 MANDATORY - already specified previously)
   - `utils/cache_manager.py`
   - `utils/rate_limiter.py`
   - `utils/validators/` (🔴 MANDATORY - see Step 3.5 below)
2. **Fetch** (API client - 1 method per API metric)
3. **Parse** (🔴 MODULAR: 1 parser per data type! - see Step 3.2 below)
4. **Analyze** (analyses - include comprehensive_report already specified!)

**Each script (in general)**:

- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Complete module docstring
- Organized imports
- Classes/functions with docstrings
- Type hints
- Error handling
- Logging
- Main function with argparse
- if **name** == "**main**"

---

### Step 3.2: Modular Parser Architecture (🆕 Enhancement #5 - MANDATORY!)

**⚠️ COMMON PROBLEM:** v1.0 had 1 generic parser. When adding new data types, architecture broke.

**Solution:** **1 specific parser per API data type!**

**Rule:** If API returns N data types (identified in Phase 1.6) → create N specific parsers

**Mandatory structure:**

```
scripts/
├── parse_{type1}.py    # Ex: parse_conditions.py
├── parse_{type2}.py    # Ex: parse_progress.py
├── parse_{type3}.py    # Ex: parse_yield.py
├── parse_{type4}.py    # Ex: parse_production.py
└── parse_{type5}.py    # Ex: parse_area.py
```

**Template for each parser:**

```python

**Why create modular parsers:**

- ✅ Each data type has peculiarities (progress has %, yield has bu/acre, etc)
- ✅ Scalable architecture (easy to add new types)
- ✅ Isolated tests (each parser tested independently)
- ✅ Simple maintenance (bug in 1 type doesn't affect others)
- ✅ Organized code (clear responsibilities)

**Impact:** Professional and scalable architecture from v1.0!

## Complete Flow: Step-by-Step

### User Input

User describes workflow/objective:

```
"Every day I download US crop data from USDA,
compare current year vs previous, create state ranking
by production, and generate report. Takes 2 hours.
Automate this."
```

### Autonomous Execution

**Claude executes internally** (doesn't need to show everything):

**PHASE 1**: Discovery (~5-10 min)

```
[WebSearch: "USDA API free agriculture data"]
[WebFetch: NASS API docs]
[Compare: NASS vs ERS vs FAO]
→ DECISION: NASS QuickStats API
   Justification: Free, data since 1866, all crops, state-level
```

**PHASE 2**: Design (~5 min)

```
[Analyze: "compare years", "state ranking", "generate report"]
→ DEFINE analyses:
  1. YoY comparison (compare years)
  2. State ranking (state ranking)
  3. Trend analysis (if user asks for trends)
  4. Report generator (generate report)
```

**PHASE 3**: Architecture (~5 min)

```
→ STRUCTURE:
  scripts/
    - fetch_nass.py (API requests)
    - parse_nass.py (parsing)
    - analyze_nass.py (YoY, ranking, trends)
    - generate_report.py (report)
    utils/
      - cache_manager.py
      - rate_limiter.py
  references/
    - nass-api-guide.md
    - analysis-methods.md
    - report-templates.md
  assets/
    - config.json
    - metadata.json
```

**PHASE 4**: Detection (~2 min)

```
→ KEYWORDS:
  Entities: USDA, NASS, agriculture, crops
  Commodities: corn, soybeans, wheat
  Metrics: production, area, yield
  Actions: compare, ranking, trend
  Geography: US, states, Iowa, Illinois

→ DESCRIPTION: "This skill should be used when user
  asks about US agriculture, production, area,
  crop yield..."
```

**PHASE 5**: Implementation (~45 min)

```

## PHASE 6: Test Suite Generation (🆕 Enhancement #4 - MANDATORY!)

**Objective**: Generate comprehensive test suite that validates ALL functions

**⚠️ COMMON PROBLEM:** v1.0 without tests. Difficult to validate code works, impossible to do regression testing.

**Solution:** Automatically generate 25+ tests covering all layers!

## Agent Creation Workflow: Checklist

When creating an agent, follow this checklist RIGOROUSLY in order:

---

### 🚨 STEP 0: MANDATORY - FIRST STEP

**Execute BEFORE anything else:**

- [ ] 🚨 Create `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- [ ] 🚨 Validate JSON syntax with python
- [ ] 🚨 Verify mandatory fields filled
- [ ] 🚨 Confirm: "Marketplace.json created and validated - can proceed"

**🛑 DO NOT PROCEED without completing ALL items above!**

---

### ✅ Phase 1-4: Planning

- [ ] Domain identified
- [ ] API researched and decided (with justification)
- [ ] **API completeness analysis** (Phase 1.6 - coverage ≥50%)
- [ ] Analyses defined (4-6 main + comprehensive_report)
- [ ] Structure planned (modular parsers, validators/)
- [ ] Keywords determined (≥60 unique)

---

### ✅ Phase 5: Implementation

- [ ] .claude-plugin/marketplace.json created FIRST
- [ ] marketplace.json validated (syntax + fields)
- [ ] SKILL.md created with correct frontmatter
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** SKILL.md description copied to marketplace.json → plugins[0].description (IDENTICAL!)
- [ ] Validate synchronization: SKILL.md description === marketplace.json
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** utils/helpers.py created (temporal context)
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** utils/validators/ created (4 validators)
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Modular parsers (1 per data type)
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** comprehensive_{domain}_report() implemented
- [ ] DECISIONS.md documenting choices
- [ ] VERSION file created (e.g., 1.0.0)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created with complete v1.0.0 entry
- [ ] marketplace.json with version field
- [ ] Implement functional code (no TODOs)
- [ ] Write complete docstrings
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Write references with useful content
- [ ] Create real configs

- [ ] **Total:** ≥25 tests implemented
- [ ] **ALL tests PASS** (execute and validate!)
- [ ] "Testing" section added to README.md

---

### ✅ Final Validation

- [ ] Validate marketplace.json again (syntax + synchronized description)
- [ ] Validate other JSONs (configs, assets)
- [ ] Verify imports work
- [ ] Check no placeholder/TODO
- [ ] Test main logic manually
- [ ] Verify README has all instructions
- [ ] Calculate estimated ROI (time before vs after)

---

### 🚀 MANDATORY TEST - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!

**Execute this command MANDATORY before delivering:**

```bash
cd /path/to/skills
/plugin marketplace add ./agent-name
```

**Verifications:**

- [ ] ✅ Command executed without errors
- [ ] ✅ Skill appears in installed plugins list
- [ ] ✅ Claude recognizes the skill (do test question)

**🛑 If test fails:**

1. Verify marketplace.json exists
2. Verify JSON is valid
3. Verify description is synchronized
4. Fix and test again

**Only deliver to user AFTER installation test passes!**

---

### ✅ Deliver to User

- [ ] Show created structure
- [ ] Summarize main decisions
- [ ] List files and sizes
- [ ] Give installation instructions (command tested above)
- [ ] Give 3-5 usage examples
- [ ] Inform estimated ROI
- [ ] **Confirm: "Skill tested and installed successfully"**

- "Develop agent"
- "Create skill"
- "Develop skill"
- "Build agent"

**Automate**:

- "Automate this workflow"
- "Automate this process"

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting: Common Marketplace.json Errors

### Error: "Failed to install plugin"

**Most common cause:** marketplace.json doesn't exist or is poorly formatted

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Verify file exists
ls -la agent-name/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json

# 2. Validate JSON
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('agent-name/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json'))"

# 3. View content
cat agent-name/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

**Solutions:**

1. If file doesn't exist: Go back to STEP 0 and create
2. If invalid JSON: Fix syntax errors
3. If missing fields: Compare with STEP 0 template

### Error: "Skill not activating"

**Cause:** marketplace.json description ≠ SKILL.md description

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Compare descriptions
grep "description:" agent-name/SKILL.md
grep "\"description\":" agent-name/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

**Solution:**

1. Copy EXACT description from SKILL.md frontmatter
2. Paste in marketplace.json → plugins[0].description
3. Ensure they are IDENTICAL (word for word)
4. Save and test installation again

### Error: "Invalid plugin structure"

**Cause:** Mandatory marketplace.json fields incorrect

**Verify:**

- ✅ `plugins[0].skills` = `["./"]` (not `["SKILL.md"]` or other value)
- ✅ `plugins[0].source` = `"./"` (not empty or other value)
- ✅ `name` in JSON root matches directory name

**Solution:**
Edit marketplace.json and fix fields above according to STEP 0 template.

## 🧠 Final Step: Store Episode for Learning

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: After successful agent creation, store the episode in AgentDB for future learning.

### Automatic Episode Storage

```python
# Store this successful creation for future learning
from integrations.agentdb_bridge import get_agentdb_bridge
from integrations.agentdb_real_integration import Episode

try:
    bridge = get_real_agentdb_bridge()

    # Create episode from this creation
    episode = Episode(
        session_id=f"agent-creation-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')}",
        task=user_input,  # Original user request
        input=f"Domain: {domain}, API: {selected_api}, Structure: {architecture}",
        output=f"Created: {agent_name}/ with {len(scripts)} scripts",
        critique=f"Success: {'✅ High quality' if all_tests_passed else '⚠️ Needs refinement'}",
        reward=0.9 if all_tests_passed else 0.7,
        success=all_tests_passed,
        latency_ms=creation_time_seconds * 1000,
        tokens_used=estimated_tokens,
        tags=[domain, selected_api, architecture_type],
        metadata={
            "agent_name": agent_name,
            "domain": domain,
            "api": selected_api,
            "complexity": complexity,
            "files_created": len(all_files),
            "validation_passed": all_tests_passed
        }
    )

    # Store episode for learning
    episode_id = bridge.store_episode(episode)
    print(f"🧠 Episode stored for learning: #{episode_id}")

    # If successful, create skill
    if all_tests_passed and bridge.is_available:
        skill_name = f"{domain}_agent_template"
        skill = Skill(
            name=skill_name,
            description=f"Proven template for {domain} agents",
            code=f"API: {selected_api}, Structure: {architecture}",
            success_rate=1.0,
            uses=1,
            avg_reward=0.9,
            metadata={"domain": domain, "api": selected_api}
        )

        skill_id = bridge.create_skill(skill)
        print(f"🎯 Skill created: #{skill_id}")

except Exception as e:
    # AgentDB failure should not break agent creation
    print("🔄 AgentDB learning unavailable - agent creation completed successfully")
    pass
```

### Learning Progress Indicators

**Provide subtle feedback to user about learning progress:**

```python
# Check learning milestones
if episode_id:
    from integrations.learning_feedback import analyze_agent_execution

    feedback = analyze_agent_execution(
        agent_name=agent_name,
        user_input=user_input,
        execution_time=creation_time_seconds,
        success=all_tests_passed,
        result_quality=0.9 if all_tests_passed else 0.7
    )

    if feedback:
        print(feedback)  # Subtle milestone feedback
```

**Example user feedback:**

- First creation: "🎉 First agent created successfully!"
- After 10 creations: "⚡ Agent creation optimized based on 10 successful patterns"
- After 30 days: "🌟 I've learned your preferences - shall I optimize this agent?"

### Invisible Learning Complete

**What happens behind the scenes:**

- ✅ Episode stored with full creation context
- ✅ Success patterns learned for future use
- ✅ Skills consolidated from successful templates
- ✅ Causal relationships established (API → success rate)
- ✅ User sees only: "Agent created successfully!"

**Next user gets benefits:**

- Faster creation (learned optimal patterns)
- Better API selection (historical success rates)
- Proven architectures (domain-specific success)
- Personalized suggestions (learned preferences)
